    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been astronomical advances in computing power and device interconnectivity over the past few decades. It has reached the point where we can harness the power of a vast quantity of data to make better decisions, faster. Over the last 5 years or so, the field of work dedicated to doing all that’s needed to make this happen has become what is now known as **data science**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is booming at the moment, with many opportunities for innovation and job placement across industries. But who exactly is a \"Data Scientist\"? What do they do in day-to-day life? What tools do they use?\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Data science\" is a misnomer\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first - *<b>the VAST majority of jobs that leverage data skills are NOT \"Data Scientist\" jobs</b>*. This means that the term \"data science\" is a misnomer. Job families such as \"Data Analyst\", \"Data Engineer\", and \"Business Intelligence Analyst\" (among others) command an order of magnitude more job openings than \"Data Scientist\" while still leveraging data skills to a considerable extent. In fact, a large number of \"Data Scientist\" jobs are misclassified and would fit better under one of the other three job families mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, all of these jobs fall under the general umbrella of **data professionals**. A data professional is someone who combines knowledge across 3 main disciplines in some combination (the exact combination will depend on the job family):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Math & Statistics (mainly statistics).** From here we need the skills of analysis & modeling, which is the art of deducing and representing things about the world using logical principles. Assorted mathematical knowledge is sometimes necessary or very helpful here.\n",
    "* **Computer Science.** From here we need the skill of coding or programming, which is the practice of writing instructions which a computer can understand to bring our analysis & modeling to life.\n",
    "* **Business Expertise.** We need this in order to guide our analysis & modeling and to correctly act on the results of it.\n",

    "### The programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to code something for our computer to do, we must communicate with it in a language that both we and the computer can understand. This common language is known as a **programming language**. A programming language translates instructions readable by a human into instructions readable by the computer, which is commonly known as **machine code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages have some things in common with languages like English or Spanish. For example (and this is very important!) they are (or really should be) understandable by humans. Similar to English or Spanish, they have rules on how they should be used (i.e. spelling, grammar, syntax).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, programming languages are much more strict in enforcing these rules than human languages are. If the rules of a programming language are not followed exactly, your program won’t **compile**, which means that the computer was not able to translate your instructions into machine code. On the flip side, the fact that they are strict makes it easier for a group of people to read and work on code together (a huge boon as great things are often created by teams), and makes what the code does unambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many programming languages, but for this program and for most data work out there, there is one king above all...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enter Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming language of choice for data work today is **Python**. (There are others such as R, Scala, or Julia, but they are far, far behind in market share and in the amount of functionality they offer for data work.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Python](data/images/python.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is great for 3 important reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is easy to learn\n",
    "* It is easy to read (many other programming languages are not!)\n",
    "* It is **open-source**, which means that it is free to use and even better - that other people in the Python community constantly add more functionality to the language for free!\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are going to code a program, you almost never start from scratch - you usually use code that was built by someone else beforehand that does a certain thing. For example, if I want to write a program that analyzes data and needs to find the average of a set of numbers, I don’t need to write the code that finds the average myself! Since it is a common problem, it’s likely that someone else already created code specifically for that purpose. I can then download that functionality from the Internet, import it into my program, and use it without much hassle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such functionalities written by other people and usable by anyone in a language are called **libraries** or **packages**. Python has libraries for anything you can think of. For the previous example, there’s the `numpy` library, which contains functionality for numerous math-heavy computations. You want something for interacting with Excel files? You can use `openpyxl`. Images? You have `Pillow`. There is something for everything - at the moment there are over 200,000 Python packages publicly available."

    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that the file you are currently reading lives inside a \"container\" called **Jupyter**. What's the big deal with Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, we must first understand what an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is. An IDE is the main tool you’ll be looking at when writing code. Code files are actually nothing more than text files, and could just as well be written in Microsoft Word, Notepad, or any other text editor. But none of those basic text editors provide other essential coding functionalities, like checking if you wrote a keyword in the wrong location, or allowing you to actually run your code immediately to test if it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that IDEs are essentially text editors on steroids, with functionality that greatly assist the coding process. One of the most popular ones for Python and data work is Jupyter because it does something almost no other IDE allows - it lets you write and run code alongside standard text (similar to combining a Word document with a code file)!\n",

    "This ability is what makes Jupyter very special for prototyping projects, testing solutions and creating deliverables that include not only code but also graphs and text and explanations. Remember when we said that performing data analysis required not only coding, but also leveraging domain knowledge? One, if not the most important, part of data analysis is explaining your results to others, and Jupyter makes this very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this through a file format called a **Jupyter notebook**. That's the kind of file you're looking at right now! To create a Jupyter notebook file, start from the Jupyter File Explorer which popped up immediately after you launched it.
